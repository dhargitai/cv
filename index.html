                            <p>David did an excellent job; I received more than I expected, convinced me of his skills.
                                [...] Smooth communication. I am not an expert, so David explained everything patiently
                                step by step helped me understand details, even with videos. I will work with David
                                again; I recommend him to others!</p>

                                    company, but also gave it a different approach and tried to deliver more than we
                                    expected, by suggesting new features and/or ways to improve the quality of our
